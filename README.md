# Utility App to Parse HTML specific to replit.ai 

I was writing an article reviewing replit.ai, I wanted to pull out the conversation threads I had with replit and catagorize the statements between requirements and reporting an error.  

Using developer tools in edge I went to the top level html and copied the element and then pasted it into a file.  I then used github copilot to help me write this utility to extract the statements and catagorize them between my user prompts and the agent responses.  This is likely a one time tool but it may be of some reference use.
